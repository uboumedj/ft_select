# 42 Unix project: ft_select

This is a small fun project that introduces us to the **termcaps** library. The goal is to make a program that takes multiple words/elements as parameters, and
displays them inside the terminal as a list. We can *navigate* in the list in all directions, *select* elements, *unselect* them, and the list should be *resizable*
depending on the terminal's width and height.

## How to use

First, compile the program with `make`. Then the program should be run as follows:

```
$> ./ft_select elem1 elem2 elem3 elem4 etc...
```
